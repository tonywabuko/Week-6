What it does:

Creates superposition and entanglement, key concepts in quantum computing.

Runs the circuit and returns the probability distribution of outcomes.

ðŸ’¡ Application: Faster Drug Discovery
Problem:
AI models in drug discovery simulate molecular structures and interactions. However, classical computers struggle with quantum-level interactions, such as electron behaviors in large molecules.

Quantum Solution:

Quantum circuits like the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) can simulate molecular energy states more efficiently than classical methods.

When combined with AI, this helps identify optimal drug compounds faster and more accurately.

Example:

AI narrows down thousands of molecules.

Quantum computers evaluate binding energies or reaction pathways.

The result is a shorter drug development cycle and reduced R&D costs.

âœ… Conclusion:
By simulating quantum circuits on IBM Quantum Experience and combining them with AI, we open the door to solving complex scientific problems like drug discovery exponentially faster than traditional approaches.
