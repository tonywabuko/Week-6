### 🔹 Q2: Quantum AI vs Classical AI in Optimization
**Comparison:**  
- Classical AI uses binary logic and sequential computing.
- Quantum AI leverages superposition and entanglement to solve complex optimization problems much faster.  
**Industries Benefiting:** Logistics, pharmaceuticals, finance, energy.

---

### 🔹 Q3: Human-AI Collaboration in Healthcare
**Impact:** AI augments roles like radiologists (image analysis) and nurses (monitoring and decision support).  
**Benefits:** Improved accuracy, efficiency, and patient care.  
**Risks:** Dependence on opaque AI systems, need for ethical oversight.

---

### 🔹 Case Study: AI-IoT for Smart Cities
**Analysis:** Integrating AI with IoT in traffic systems improves urban sustainability via real-time optimization and emission reduction.  
**Challenges:**  
1. Data Security  
2. System Interoperability
