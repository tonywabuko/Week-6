Smart Agriculture System Using AI and IoT
Overview:
This system integrates AI models with IoT sensors to optimize agricultural productivity by predicting crop yields and providing real-time environmental monitoring. By collecting data on soil, weather, and plant conditions, farmers can make informed decisions about irrigation, fertilization, and harvesting.

1. Sensors Required:
Sensor Type	Purpose
Soil Moisture Sensor	Measures water content to optimize irrigation.
Temperature Sensor	Monitors ambient temperature affecting crop growth.
Humidity Sensor	Assesses air moisture levels for disease control.
Light (LDR) Sensor	Tracks sunlight exposure for photosynthesis analysis.
pH Sensor	Measures soil acidity to maintain nutrient balance.
Rain Gauge	Records rainfall to adjust watering schedules.

2. AI Model Proposal:
Model Type:

Random Forest Regressor or LSTM Neural Network

Trained on historical data (weather patterns, soil metrics, crop type, yield) to predict crop yield (kg/hectare).

Input Features:

Real-time sensor data + historical environmental and crop data

Output:

Predicted yield and actionable insights (e.g., “Irrigate within 12 hrs”)
